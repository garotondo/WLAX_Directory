# WLAX_Directory

Networking is one of the most important skills a person can develop in life. Academic work is important; however, your network of people is what is going to help you ultimately land a job and launch a career after college. In my own job search, I found that Harvard's alumni resources are out-of-date and unreliable. To solve this problem, I developed an accurate and functional alumni directory of the Harvard Women's Lacrosse Program. I compiled data using graduation data from Harvard resources as well as career and contact data from LinkedIn and Google. The goal of this project was to create a platform for members of the Harvard Women's Lacrosse Program to find accurate alumni information and create a better connected alumni community.
