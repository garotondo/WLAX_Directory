## Abstract ##

Networking is one of the most important skills a person can develop and in life. Grades are important; however your network of people is what is going to help you ultimately land a job and launch a career after college. In my own job search, I found that Harvard's alumni resources are out-of-date and unreliable. To solve this problem, I developed an accurate and functional alumni directory on a much for the Harvard Women's Lacrosse Program. I compiled data using several Harvard resources as well as LinkedIn. Through this process, I found that Harvard Women's Lacrosse almni hold many powerful positions.
